# scaling-pancake
# hello-world

Hi Hubbers,

I love pancakes and the idea of them scaling, which would free me from having to make them again and again, as they would just grow by themself. It would be my obligation to eat them to keep them from growing too big. So I went with the suggested name before changing it to hello world.
When not eating or drinking I play LoL, Bomberman and card games and I enjoy diving, birding and gardening (= watching my herbs wither and almost die before resuscitating them with a glas of water).
